## Analysis

### YouTube Analysis

- **Implementation**: Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5TURBO API for high-level natural language processing, which directly streams the processed data for real-time analysis.

## Comment Exploration
ThreadMind also allows users to browse through comments and their corresponding replies, thus offering a more nuanced understanding of public sentiment in addition to the analytical data provided.

## Additional Features
